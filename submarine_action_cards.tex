\section*{Action Cards}
Starting with Player 1, take turns playing action cards.
Each action card can be played to perform either a \emph{movement action} or a \emph{utility action}.

When you play an action card, place it on left-hand side (from your perspective) of the play area with the action you are using it to perform closest to the center of the play area.

If the action name is written in yellow, play the card face up. Otherwise, play it face down.

Some actions have \emph{tags}, e.g.  \LOUD{}, \QUIET{}, and \DEEP{}, that affect their behavior. In particular, \LOUD{} actions always reveal your location.

After you play an action card, perform the action described thereon.
Then, add the action card on the right-hand side (from your perspective) of the play area to your hand.
