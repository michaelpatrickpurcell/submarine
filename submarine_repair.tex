\section*{Damage and Repair}
%If your adversary takes the \LAUNCH{} or \SHOOT{} action, you may \emph{take damage}. 

When you take damage, your adversary will select two action cards in your hand to \emph{disable}.
Turn these cards sideways to indicate that they have been disabled.
Then, reveal your location.

%Action cards that have been disabled cannot be played in the usual fashion.
When you play a card that has been disabled, you may not take an action.
Instead, you are \emph{repairing} your submarine.

After playing an action card that has been disabled, add the card on the right-hand side of the play area to your hand as normal.
%So, repairing damage to your submarine reduces the number of disabled cards in your hand by one.

If all three of the action cards in your hand are disabled, then your submarine sinks. The game ends immediately and your adversary wins.

\textit{\textbf{Pro Tip:} Shuffle the action cards in your hand before your adversary selects which will be disabled when you take damage.}
