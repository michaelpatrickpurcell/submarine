\section*{Strategic Objectives}
There are five locations, \sansA{} \sansE{} \sansM{} \sansV{} \sansZ{}, where you will be able to complete strategic objectives by sending a report back to fleet command.

When at one of these locations, you may either:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
	\item Send an unencrypted report. Reveal your location to complete the strategic objective at your location. This can be done at any point during your turn and does not require you to spend an action to do so.
	\item Send an encrypted report. To do so, take the \ENCRYPT{} action (see {\setmainfont{Chakra Petch}{\textcolor{Blue}{\textbf{UTILITY ACTIONS}}}}) on your turn to complete the strategic objective at your location.
\end{itemize}

You may only complete the strategic objective at each location once per game.

\textit{\textbf{Pro Tip:} Wait to send an unencrypted report until just before you play an action card.}
