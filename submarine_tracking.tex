\section*{Tracking Locations}
During the game, you will use your location card to track your submarine's location on a \emph{grid}. 

To do so, gently pinch your location card between your thumb and one finger such that your thumb is covering your submarine's current location.
As you move, you should adjust your grip on your location card accordingly.

Two grid squares are \emph{adjacent} only if there is a line connecting them (no diagonals).

\textit{\textbf{Pro Tip:} Hold your tracking card under the table so that your adversary can't see it.}% If your adversary can see your location card, it will be much easier for them to target you.}
