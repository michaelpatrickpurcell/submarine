\section*{Tracking Locations}
During the game, you will use your location card to track your submarine's location on a \emph{grid}. 

To do so, gently pinch your location card between your thumb and middle finger such that your thumb is touching your submarine's current location.
As you move, adjust your grip on your location card accordingly.

Two grid squares are \emph{adjacent} only if there is a line connecting them (no diagonals).

\textit{\textbf{Pro Tip:} Keep your location card hidden. If your adversary can see your location card, it will be much easier for them to target you.}
