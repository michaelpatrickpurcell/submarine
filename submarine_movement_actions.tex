\subsection*{Movement Actions}
When you perform a movement action you will take a specified number of \emph{steps} by moving from your current location to an adjacent grid square.  Because it is \LOUD{}, you must reveal your location when you take the \MMMOVE{} action.
%\begin{description}[leftmargin=1em, labelwidth=0pt, labelsep=0pt]
%\item[]\MOVE{} (\QUIET{})\ \ Take 1 step.
%\item[]\MMOVE{}\ \ Take 2 steps.
%\item[]\MMMOVE{} (\LOUD{})\ \ Take 3 steps. Reveal your location.
%\end{description}
